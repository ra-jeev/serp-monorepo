          <h1>Our Story</h1>
          <p>10 years ago, we started SERP as a simple SEO agency.</p>
          <p>
            Our scope was smaller, but our drive was the same as it is today:
            helping underdogs win against the giants.
          </p>

          <p>
            We've always fought for the little guy and found ways to help them pull
            off the digital version of David v Goliath.
          </p>

          <p>Then the playing field tilted even further.</p>

          <p>
            AI advanced at breakneck speed, creating an unprecedented advantage for
            tech giants with deep pockets.
          </p>
          <p>
            These companies leveraged collective data from billions of users to
            train powerful AI systems, then locked those capabilities behind
            expensive paywalls.
          </p>

          <p>
            The gap between digital haves and have-nots widened into a chasm. The
            same technologies that promised to democratize opportunity instead
            concentrated power in fewer hands.
          </p>

          <p>
            The window to change this trajectory is closing rapidly. We may not get
            another chance.
          </p>

          <p>
            Digital power must return to its rightful owners before it's too late.
          </p>

          </p>

          <h2>For Individuals</h2>
          <p>
            We believe AI and digital tools shouldn't be locked behind corporate
            paywalls. This technology was built using everyone's online
            contributions, and now we're being charged for the fruits of that labor.
          </p>
          <p>
            So we've set out to create as many free tools and resources for the
            individual as we can.
          </p>

          <h2>Join the Alliance</h2>
          <p>
            We see ourselves as part of the Alliance standing up to a growing
            Empire. While corporations consolidate power, we're working to put that
            power back in your hands.
          </p>

          <p>But we're a small team and we can't do it alone.</p>

          <p>We need your help.</p>

          <p>
            So, if you see yourself as someone who likes to fight for the
            individual, instead of the large corporations, we want your help.
          </p>

          <p>The digital world shouldn't just work for the privileged few.</p>

          <p>Let's build it differently together, before we lose our shot.</p>

          <p>
            Join the SERP Alliance and help secure the future of the internet for
            the individual.
